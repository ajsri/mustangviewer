This might be my dumbest repo on github, but someone liked it.
Clone the repository, open index.html, and drag the slider to
see what the Ford Mustang model for that year looked like.

Literally the only reason I made this was because I saw it as
an animated GIF on reddit and wanted to see an exploded view.

And before anyone says 'Right click > Show Controls', it wasn't
an gfy/webm.
